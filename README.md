There is a pleasure in creating well-written, understandable
programs. There is a satisfaction in finding a program structure
that tames the complexity of an application. We enjoy seeing our
algorithms expressed clearly and persuasively. We also profit from
our clearly written programs, for they are much more likely to be
correct and maintainable than obscure ones.

Good artists copy. Great artists steal.
