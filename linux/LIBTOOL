Makefile.am:4: error: Libtool library used but 'LIBTOOL' is undefined
Makefile.am:4:   The usual way to define 'LIBTOOL' is to add 'LT_INIT'
Makefile.am:4:   to 'configure.ac' and run 'aclocal' and 'autoconf' again.
Makefile.am:4:   If 'LT_INIT' is in 'configure.ac', make sure
Makefile.am:4:   its definition is in aclocal's search path.
Makefile:386: recipe for target 'Makefile.in' failed
make: *** [Makefile.in] Error 1

Viewopoint 1:
didn't install aclocal

Viewpoint 2:
Install libtool

If I install aclocal using my routine. Then I need to configure routine.

aclocal --print-ac-dir
check the DIR
aclocal -I DIR

Now, it works. 


libtool: Version mismatch error.  This is libtool 2.4.6, but the
libtool: definition of this LT_INIT comes from libtool 2.4.2.
libtool: You should recreate aclocal.m4 with macros from libtool 2.4.6
libtool: and run autoconf again.
Makefile:534: recipe for target 'sqlite3.lo' failed

autoreconf -fi

Now, it works.
